This was a short C++ project that uses OpenGL to render snow falling down a screen.
Using an M1 I get an FPS of around 120.

Some future enhancements would be to use batch rendering and more memory safe and effecient entity trackers.
However, it's probably best I move on from this fun side project for now.
